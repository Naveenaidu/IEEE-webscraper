E. C.) in Bellagio, September 1927. The proposition was referred to an international subcommittee for consideration and report, by the Advisory I. E. C. Committee on Nomenclature. The subcommittee has recently reported, recommending that the matter be placed on the agenda of the next I. E. C. meeting, and that in the meanwhile, the subject should be discussed in all the national committees, more especially in the various electrical engineering societies, so as to pave the way for well considered international action. This paper has been prepared in the hope of presenting the questions definitely, with a view to eliciting discussion and opinions that may be helpful from the international point of view. As an aid to the formulation of views on the subject among those who may not have given special attention to the historical development of the magnetic-circuit units, a short outline of their history is here submitted.","authors": [{"name": "Arthur E.

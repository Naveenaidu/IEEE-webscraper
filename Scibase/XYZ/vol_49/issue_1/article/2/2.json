Torsional vibration of the motor is caused by unbalanced windings or applied voltages. Vibration of the rotor simulating a mechanically unbalanced rotor is caused by two fields differing by two poles and not of the same frequency or direction of rotation. Vibration of the stator by distortion from a circular shape results from the presence of other simple combinations of fields. Teeth tend to vibrate axially at double applied frequency. The magnetic noise produced by a motor can be predicted from a qualitative analysis of the air-gap field supplemented by an approximate quantitative analysis and consideration of the stiffness of the parts.","authors": [{"name": "L.

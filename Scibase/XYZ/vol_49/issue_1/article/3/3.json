The Chicago toll office, which serves 1,200,000 stations, recently has been replaced largely with new equipment. This equipment, together with correlated improvements in handling toll service at Chicago, is described in this paper. The work of the toll operator in handling toll calls with the new equipment is compared with the former method. It is this change in operating practise which constitutes a major improvement in long distance service. The paper also includes d description of the toll lines entering Chicago, with their equipment arrangements including telephone repeaters, the power plants required to operate this equipment and that associated with the switchboards. The addendum describes the purpose of the auxiliary and special switchboards which are required in large installations only, such as those in Chicago.","authors": [{"name": "E. O.

The proposed technique mainly differs from most existing techniques in that it takes into account filtering operations, e.g., interpolation in subpixel motion compensation, as introduced in advanced video codecs. The distortion estimation for pixels or subpixels under filtering operations requires the computation of the second moment of a weighted sum of random variables. In this paper, we prove a proposition for calculating the second moment of a weighted sum of correlated random variables without requiring knowledge of their probability distribution. Then, we apply the proposition to extend our previous error-resilient algorithm for prediction mode decision without significantly increasing complexity. Experimental results using an H.264/AVC codec show that our new algorithm provides an improvement in both rate-distortion performance and subjective quality over existing algorithms. Our algorithm can also be applied in the upcoming high-efficiency video coding standard, where additional filtering techniques are under consideration.","authors": [{"name": "Zhifeng Chen", "affiliation": "Interdigital, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6177735/6041018/6041018-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Zhifeng Chen received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2010.", "From 2002 to 2003, he was an Engineer with EPSON, Beijing, China, and from 2003 to 2006, he was a Senior Engineer with Philips, Shanghai, China, working on mobile phone system solution design.

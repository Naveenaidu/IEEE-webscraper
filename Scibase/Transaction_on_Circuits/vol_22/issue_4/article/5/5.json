In this paper, we derive a set of separable mode-dependent transforms by using a simple separable, directional, and anisotropic image correlation model. Our analysis shows that only one additional transform, the odd type-3 discrete sine transform (ODST-3), is required for the optimal implementation of mode-dependent transforms. In addition, the four-point ODST-3 also has a structure that can be exploited to reduce the operation count of the transform operation. Experimental results show that in terms of coding efficiency, our proposed approach matches or improves upon the performance of a mode-dependent transforms approach that uses transform matrices obtained through training.","authors": [{"name": "Chuohao Yeo", "affiliation": "Signal Processing Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6177735/6020769/6020769-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Chuohao Yeo (S'05\u2013M'09) received the S.B. degree in electrical science and engineering and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California (UC) at Berkeley, Berkeley, in 2009.", "From 2005 to 2009, he was a Graduate Student Researcher with the Berkeley Audio Visual Signal Processing and Communication Systems Laboratory, UC Berkeley.

It proposes a two-layer transform structure, where the first layer uses discrete wavelet transform to compact the residue energy to the LL band and then the second layer uses 2-D nonseparable directional transforms to deal with the arbitrary edge directions in the four subbands. By doing this, the edges in a macroblock are efficiently compacted to a few coefficients and at the same time the overhead used to indicate the transform directions is affordable. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides peak signal-to-noise ratio gain up to 0.46 dB, compared with H.264/AVC High Profile.","authors": [{"name": "Jie Dong", "affiliation": "Office of the Chief Technical Officer, InterDigital Communications, San Diego, CA, USA", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6177735/6041016/6041016-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Jie Dong (S'07\u2013M'10) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in information engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, in 2009.", "In 2010, she was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

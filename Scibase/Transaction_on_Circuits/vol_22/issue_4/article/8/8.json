Pixel-level storage elements (capacitors) enable the sensor to simultaneously output two consecutive frames, with temporal differences digitalized into binary events by a global differentiator. An on-chip, hardware-implemented, clustering-based algorithm processes events on the fly and localizes up to three moving objects in the scene. The sensor can automatically switch to region of interest mode and capture a picture of the object. The proposed image sensor was implemented using UMC 0.18 &#x03BC;m CMOS technology with a die area of 1.5 mm &#x00D7; 1.5 mm, and power consumption was only 0.4 mW at 100 FPS.","authors": [{"name": "Bo Zhao", "affiliation": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6177735/6032080/6032080-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Bo Zhao (S'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

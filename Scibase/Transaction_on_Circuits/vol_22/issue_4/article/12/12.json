However, these inclusions significantly increase chip design difficulties such as decoding time, memory bandwidth, and area cost. This paper presents an H.264/AVC scalable high profile decoder realization with several optimization techniques to provide high throughput video decoding. For decoding flow, this paper proposes an one-pass macroblock-based quality layer decoding flow for SNR scalability and 71% of external memory bandwidth and 66% of macroblock processing cycles can be saved. For texture padding in interlayer intra prediction, the modified padding flow can save 26% of decoding time. For interlayer predictor design, this paper proposes a centralized concept for accumulation-based calculation of corresponding spatial position, simplified poly-phase interpolator, and efficient motion vector generator to save area cost and decoding time. Furthermore, the residual reconstruction path with the parallel-pipeline architecture is also proposed to cope with the additional decoding complexity and thus leads to 54% of gate count savings compared to the traditional serial-pipeline architecture. Finally, the proposed H.264/AVC scalable high profile decoder design is implemented with 90 nm CMOS technology and it costs 542 k gate count and 39.66 Kbytes on-chip memory while is capable to decode 60 frames/s for resolution with three quality layers at 135 MHz operating frequency.","authors": [{"name": "Gwo-Long Li", "affiliation": "Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6177735/6041017/6041017-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Gwo-Long Li received the B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Shu-Te University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2004, the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong-Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011.", "He is currently an Engineer with the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu.

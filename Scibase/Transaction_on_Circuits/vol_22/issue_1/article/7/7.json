GV bridges the gap of 3-D motion data and 2-D video, and provides a natural way to apply the well-studied video processing techniques to motion data processing. Our framework includes a set of algorithms to construct GVs, such as hole filling, geodesic-based face segmentation, expression-invariant parameterization (EIP), and GV compression. Our EIP algorithm can guarantee the exact correspondence of the salient features (eyes, mouth, and nose) in different frames, which leads to GVs with better spatial and temporal coherence than that of the conventional parameterization methods. By taking advantage of this feature, we also propose a new H.264/AVC-based progressive directional prediction scheme, which can provide further 10%-16% bitrate reductions compared to the original H.264/AVC applied for GV compression while maintaining good video quality. Our experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GV is very effective for modeling the high-resolution 3-D expression data, thus providing an attractive way in expression information processing for gaming and movie industry.","authors": [{"name": "Jiazhi Xia", "affiliation": "School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6121964/5782944/5782944-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Jiazhi Xia received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

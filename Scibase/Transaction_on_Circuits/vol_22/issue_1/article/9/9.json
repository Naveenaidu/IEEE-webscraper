Based on the Lucas-Kanade method, we adopt an improved gradient-based algorithm that can adaptively select a pseudo-variable frame rate according to the amplitude of the estimated optical flow to accurately detect the optical flow for objects moving at high and low speeds in the same image. The performance of our developed HFR optical flow system was verified through experimental results for high-speed movements such as a top's spinnning motion and a human's pitching motion.","authors": [{"name": "Idaku Ishii", "affiliation": "Department of System Cybernetics, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6121964/5782945/5782945-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Idaku Ishii (M'06) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in mathematical engineering and information physics from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1992, 1994, and 2000, respectively.", "Currently, he is a Professor with Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.

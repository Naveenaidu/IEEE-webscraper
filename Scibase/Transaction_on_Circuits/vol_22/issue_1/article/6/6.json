By automatically detecting and transmitting only the differences between video files, VSYNC is able to avoid unnecessary re-transmission of the entire video when there are only minor differences between video copies. A hierarchical hashing scheme is designed to allow synchronization to within some user-defined distortion, white being rate-efficient and computationally tractable. Distributed video coding is used to realize further rate savings when transmitting video updates. VSYNC is bandwidth-efficient and is useful in many scenarios including video backup, video sharing, and video authentication applications. Experimental results show that rate-savings ranging from 2&#x00D7; to 10&#x00D7; can be obtained by VSYNC with about 10% of the frames being edited, compared to re- transmitting the compressed video or using a file synchronization utility such as rsync.","authors": [{"name": "Hao Zhang", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6121964/5783338/5783338-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Hao Zhang (S'06\u2013M'09) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006, and the M.A. degree in statistics and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California (UC) at Berkeley, Berkeley, in 2009.

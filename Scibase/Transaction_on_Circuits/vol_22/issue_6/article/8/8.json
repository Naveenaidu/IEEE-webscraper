The evaluation measures typically used to this end are nonlinear combinations of precision-recall or coverage-overflow, which are not metrics and additionally possess undesirable properties, such as nonsymmetricity. To alleviate these drawbacks, we introduce a novel unidimensional measure that is proven to be metric and satisfies a number of qualitative prerequisites that previous measures do not. This measure is named differential edit distance (DED), since it can be seen as a variation of the well-known edit distance. After defining DED, we further introduce an algorithm that computes it in less than cubic time. Finally, DED is extensively compared with state-of-the-art measures, namely, the harmonic means (F-score) of precision-recall and coverage-overflow. The experiments include comparisons of qualitative properties, the time required for optimizing the parameters of scene segmentation algorithms with the help of these measures, and a user study gauging the agreement of these measures with the users' assessment of the segmentation results. The results confirm that the proposed measure is a unidimensional metric that is effective in evaluating scene segmentation techniques and in helping to optimize their parameters.","authors": [{"name": "Panagiotis Sidiropoulos", "affiliation": "Informatics and Telematics Institute/Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6111460/6111460-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Panagiotis Sidiropoulos received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering in 2003 and the M.S. degree in informatics in 2007, both from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.

The cyclic DAC architecture is used to reduce the area of LCD column drivers when compared to the use of conventional resistor-string DACs. The current interpolation technique is proposed to perform gamma correction after D/A conversion. The gamma correction circuit is shared by four DAC channels using the interleave technique. A prototype 10-bit DAC with gamma correction function is implemented in 0.35 &#x03BC;m CMOS technology and its average die size per channel is 0.053 mm<sup>2</sup>, which is smaller than those of the R-DACs with gamma correction function. The settling time of the 10-bit DAC is 1 &#x03BC;s, and the maximum INL and DNL are 2.13 least significant bit (LSB) and 1.30 LSB, respectively.","authors": [{"name": "Pang-Jung Liu", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6148267/6148267-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Pang-Jung Liu (S'08\u2013M'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 2010.", "From 2000 to 2003, he was a Testing Engineer with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, San Jose, CA.

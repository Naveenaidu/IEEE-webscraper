Compared to the ACM with global energy terms, the proposed system provides a more precise lips contour convergence under the circumstances where the lips are difficult to distinguish using global statistics. Furthermore, since the ACM is sensitive to the initial contour position, a modified <i>H</i><sub>&#x221E;</sub> based on Lyapunov stability theory is proposed to provide better tracking of the subsequent lips feature points as the ACM initialization. The integration of the proposed ACM and modified <i>H</i><sub>&#x221E;</sub> has revealed an improvement of the overall lips contour detection.","authors": [{"name": "Siew Wen Chin", "affiliation": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Selangor, Malaysia", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6111275/6111275-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Siew Wen Chin received the Bachelors and M.

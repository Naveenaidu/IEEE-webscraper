In order to guarantee layered utility maximization, the initial nominal joint source and network optimization is defined, where each scalable layer is tailored in an incremental order and finds jointly optimal multicast paths and associated rates with network coding. To enhance the robustness of the nominal convex optimization formulation with nonlinear constraints, we reserve partial bandwidth for backup paths disjoint from the primal paths. It considers the path-overlapping allocation of backup paths for different receivers to take advantage of network coding, and takes into account the robust multipath rate-control and bandwidth reservation problem for scalable video multicast streaming when possible link failures of primary paths exist. Specifically, an uncertainty set of the wireless medium capacity is introduced to represent the uncertain and time-varying property of parameters related to the wireless channel. The targeted uncertainty in the robust optimization problem is studied in a form of protection functions with nonlinear constraints, to analyze the tradeoff between robustness and distributedness. Using the dual decomposition and primal-dual update approach, we develop a fully decentralized algorithm with regard to communication overhead. Through extensive experimental results under critical performance factors, the proposed algorithm could converge to the optimal steady-state more quickly, and adapt the dynamic network changes in an optimal tradeoff between optimization performance and robustness than existing optimization schemes.","authors": [{"name": "Chenglin Li", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6145629/6145629-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Chenglin Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.", "His current research interests include network-oriented image/video processing and communication, and the network-based optimization for video sources."]}}, {"name": "Hongkai Xiong", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6145629/6145629-photo-2-small.gif", "p": ["Hongkai Xiong (M'01\u2013SM'10) received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China, in 2003.", "Since 2003, he has been with the Department of Electronic Engineering, SJTU, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

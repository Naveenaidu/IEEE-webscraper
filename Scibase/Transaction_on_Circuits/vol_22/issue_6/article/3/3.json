Recent research has found that the use of larger transforms, such as 16 &#x00D7; 16, together with the existing transforms can improve coding performance especially in high-definition (HD) videos which are becoming more and more common. This raises the interest of seeking high-performance higher-order transforms with low computation requirement. In this paper, a method to derive orthogonal integer cosine transforms is proposed. The order-2N transform is defined using the order-N transform. A family of these integer transforms, Loeffler, Ligtenberg, and Moschytz (LLM) integer cosine transform, is derived using this method. Its fast algorithm structure is the same as LLM fast discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm but requires integer operations only. This new family of transforms is not only very close to the DCT but also has excellent coding performance.","authors": [{"name": "Chi-Keung Fong", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6093952/6093952-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Chi-Keung Fong (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, in 1999, and the M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, in 2003 and 2011, respectively.", "His current research interests include transform coding, pattern matching, and image processing."]}}, {"name": "Wai-Kuen Cham", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6093952/6093952-photo-2-small.gif", "p": ["Wai-Kuen Cham (S'77\u2013M'79\u2013SM'91) received the Bachelors degree in electronics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, in 1979, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Loughborough University of Technology, Leicestershire, U.K., in 1980 and 1983, respectively.", "Since May 1985, he has been with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

In this paper, we study the use of motion information and temporal human visual system (HVS) characteristics for objective video quality assessment. In our previous work, two types of spatial distortions, i.e., detail losses and additive impairments, are decoupled and evaluated separately for spatial quality assessment. The detail losses refer to the loss of useful visual information that will affect the content visibility, and the additive impairments represent the redundant visual information in the test image, such as the blocking or ringing artifacts caused by data compression and so on. In this paper, a novel full-reference video quality metric is developed, which conceptually comprises the following processing steps: 1) decoupling detail losses and additive impairments within each frame for spatial distortion measure; 2) analyzing the video motion and using the HVS characteristics to simulate the human perception of the spatial distortions; and 3) taking into account cognitive human behaviors to integrate frame-level quality scores into sequence-level quality score. Distinguished from most studies in the literature, the proposed method comprehensively investigates the use of motion information in the simulation of HVS processing, e.g., to model the eye movement, to predict the spatio-temporal HVS contrast sensitivity, to implement the temporal masking effect, and so on. Furthermore, we also prove the effectiveness of decoupling detail losses and additive impairments for video quality assessment. The proposed method is tested on two subjective quality video databases, LIVE and IVP, and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in matching subjective ratings.","authors": [{"name": "Songnan Li", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6227366/6166870/6166870-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Songnan Li (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

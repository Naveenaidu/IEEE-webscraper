A Computational Aesthetics Approach","publicationTitle": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","abstract": "Understanding the characteristics of high-quality professional videos is important for video classification, video quality measurement, and video enhancement. A professional video is good not only for its interesting story but also for its high visual quality. In this paper, we study what makes a professional video from the perspective of aesthetics. We discuss how a professional video is created and correspondingly design a variety of features that distinguish professional videos from amateur ones. We study general aesthetics features that are applied to still photos and extend them to videos. We design a variety of features that are particularly relevant to videos. We examined the performance of these features in the problem of professional and amateur video classification. Our experiments show that with these features, 97.3% professional and amateur shot classification accuracy rate is achieved on our own data set and 91.2% professional video detection rate is achieved on a public professional video set. Our experiments also show that the features that are particularly for videos are shown most effective for this task.","authors": [{"name": "Yuzhen Niu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Portland State University, Portland, OR, USA", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6227366/6162974/6162974-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Yuzhen Niu received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.", "She is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Computer Science, Portland State University, Portland, OR.

The proposed PBH feature significantly reduces the training time by a factor of at least 1440 compared to the traditional Haar-like feature. Moreover, lower computation and high tracking accuracy are also provided simultaneously. Yet, one of the disadvantages of the PBHFA is the false positive which is the consequence of the appearance of complex background in positive samples. To effectively reduce the false positive rate, the skin color segmentation and the foreground detection by applying the CB model are catered for rejecting all of the candidates which are not hand targets. As documented in the experimental results, the proposed system can achieve promising results, and thus it can be considered as an effective candidate in handling practical applications which require hand postures.","authors": [{"name": "Jing-Ming Guo", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6093954/6093954-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Jing-Ming Guo (M'06\u2013SM'10) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on November 19, 1972.

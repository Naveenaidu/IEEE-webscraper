However, the increased luminance resolution comes at price of chrominance distortion. A major challenge is to suppress color fringing artifacts while maintaining sharpness. We propose a new subpixel-based down-sampling pattern called diagonal direct subpixel-based down-sampling (DDSD) for which we design a 2-D image reconstruction model. Then, we formulate subpixel-based down-sampling as a MMSE problem and derive the optimal solution called minimum mean square error for subpixel-based down-sampling (MMSE-SD). Unfortunately, straightforward implementation of MMSE-SD is computational intensive. We thus prove that the solution is equivalent to a 2-D linear filter followed by DDSD, which is much simpler. We further reduce computational complexity using a small <i>k</i> &#x00D7; <i>k</i> filter to approximate the much larger MMSE-SD filter. To compare the performances of pixel and subpixel-based down-sampling methods, we propose two novel objective measures: normalized <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> high frequency energy for apparent luminance sharpness and PSNR<sub>U(V)</sub> for chrominance distortion. Simulation results show that both MMSE-SD and MMSE-SD(<i>k</i>) can give sharper images compared with conventional down-sampling methods, with little color fringing artifacts.","authors": [{"name": "Lu Fang", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6101564/6101564-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Lu Fang received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in June 2007.

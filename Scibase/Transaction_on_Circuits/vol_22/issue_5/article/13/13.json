This paper presents a rate control method for H.264/AVC, using a new bit allocation scheme for both I-frame and P-frame. This scheme is based on our proposed frame complexity measurement and estimation model. The measurement model considers not only the absolute complexity of I-frame and P-frame, respectively, but also the complexity relationship between I-frame and P-frame. Our proposed bit allocation scheme is able to allocate bit rate more efficiently for both I-frame and P-frame in order to achieve a relatively steady visual quality. Experimental results show that our proposed method is capable of providing more stable video quality than other existing methods.","authors": [{"name": "Bo Yan", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6111278/6111278-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Bo Yan (SM'10) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in communication engineering, both from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, in 2004.", "From 2004 to 2006, he was with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, as a Post-Doctoral Guest Researcher.

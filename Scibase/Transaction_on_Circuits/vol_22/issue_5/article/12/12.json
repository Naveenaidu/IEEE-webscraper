In this paper, we investigate the application of CS paradigms on single image super-resolution (SR) problems that are considered to be the most challenging in this class. In light of recent promising results, we propose novel tools for analyzing sparse representation-based inverse problems using redundant dictionary basis. Further, we provide novel results establishing tighter correspondence between SR and CS. As such, we gain insights into questions concerning regularizing the solution to the underdetermined problem, such as follows. 1) Is sparsity prior alone sufficient? 2) What is a good dictionary? 3) What is the practical implication of noncompliance with theoretical CS hypothesis? Unlike in other underdetermined problems that assume random down-projections, the low-resolution image formation model employed in CS-based SR is a deterministic down-projection that may not necessarily satisfy some critical assumptions of CS. We further investigate the impact of such projections in concern to the above questions.","authors": [{"name": "Naveen Kulkarni", "affiliation": "Research in Motion Corporation, Irving, TX, USA", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6111276/6111276-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Naveen Kulkarni received the B.E. degree from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, India, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, in 2011.", "He is currently a Video Systems Engineer with Research in Motion Corporation, Waterloo, ON, Canada.

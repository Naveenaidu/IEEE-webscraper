The encoding basis matrices of RIVCS for an image containing three to five regions have been reported in the literature, but no construction method has ever been studied. We develop a novel and efficient construction for RIVCS using linear programming in this paper. The proposed integer linear program aims at the minimization of the pixel expansion under the constraints for being a RIVCS. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, applicability, and flexibility of our construction. The pixel expansions and contrasts derived from our scheme are also better than the previous results.","authors": [{"name": "Shyong Jian Shyu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Ming Chuan University, Guei-Shan, Taoyuan, Taiwan", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6111277/6111277-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Shyong Jian Shyu received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1985, the M.S. degree in computer and decision sciences in 1987, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science in 1991 from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu.", "From 1991 to 1993, he was with the National Defense Management College, Jhonghe, Taiwan.

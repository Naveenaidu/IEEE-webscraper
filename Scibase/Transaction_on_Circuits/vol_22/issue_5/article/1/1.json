In this paper, we investigate the effect of vergence-accommodation conflict and parallax difference on binocular fusion for random dot stereograms. The aim of this paper is to provide a study on visual fatigue induced by the conflict. We measured the time required for fusion under various conditions that include foreground parallax, background parallax, focal distance, aperture size, and corrugation frequency. The results show that foreground parallax and parallax difference between foreground parallax and background parallax have significant influences on fusion time. In addition, we verify the relationship between fusion time and visual fatigue by conducting a subjective evaluation of stereoscopic images.","authors": [{"name": "Donghyun Kim", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6148268/6148268-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Donghyun Kim (S'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.", "His current research interests include 3-D video quality and visual fatigue assessment, and 3-D computer vision."]}}, {"name": "Sunghwan Choi", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6148268/6148268-photo-2-small.gif", "p": ["Sunghwan Choi (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Korea Aerospace University, Seoul, Korea, in 2009.

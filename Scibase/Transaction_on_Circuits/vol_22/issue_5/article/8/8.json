We first formulate the dynamic scheduling problem as a Markov decision process that explicitly considers the users' heterogeneous multimedia data characteristics (e.g., delay deadlines, distortion impacts and dependences, and so on) and time-varying channel conditions, which are not simultaneously considered in state-of-the-art packet scheduling algorithms. This formulation allows us to perform foresighted decisions to schedule multiple data units for transmission at each time in order to optimize the long-term utilities of the multimedia applications. The heterogeneity of the media data enables us to express the transmission priorities between the different data units as a priority graph, which is a directed acyclic graph. This priority graph provides us with an elegant structure to decompose the multidata unit foresighted decision at each time into multiple single-data unit foresighted decisions which can be performed sequentially, from the high priority data units to the low priority data units, thereby significantly reducing the computation complexity. When the statistical knowledge of the multimedia data characteristics and channel conditions is unknown a priori, we develop a low-complexity online learning algorithm to update the value functions, which capture the impact of the current decision on the future utility. The simulation results show that the proposed solution significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art scheduling solutions.","authors": [{"name": "Fangwen Fu", "affiliation": "Intel, Folsom, CA, USA", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6093953/6093953-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Fangwen Fu (M'10) received the Bachelors and Masters degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, in 2010.", "He is currently with Intel, Orangevale, CA, as a Media Architect.

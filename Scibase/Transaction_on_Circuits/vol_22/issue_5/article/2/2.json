In this paper, a new filter is introduced and investigated that combines both spatial and temporal information to provide subjective and objective quality improvement. The filter only requires a small overhead on slice level while using the temporal information conveyed in the bit stream to reconstruct the individual motion trajectory of every pixel in a frame at both encoder and decoder. This information is then used to perform pixel-wise adaptive motion-compensated temporal filtering. It is shown that the filter performs better than the state-of-the-art codec H.264/AVC over a large range of sequences and bit rates. Additionally, the filter is compared with another, Wiener-based in-loop filtering approach and a complexity analysis of both algorithms is conducted.","authors": [{"name": "Marko Esche", "affiliation": "Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit&#x00E4;t Berlin, Berlin, Germany", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6086601/6086601-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Marko Esche (S'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany, in 2008 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Dr.-Ing. degree.", "Since 2009, he has been a Research and Teaching Assistant with the Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin.

In RIVCS, the secret image is subdivided into multiple regions in such a way that any <i>t</i> shadow images, where 2 &#x2264; <i>t</i> &#x2264; <i>n</i>, can be used to reveal the (<i>t</i>-1) th region. However, Wang's scheme suffers from the incorrect-color problem, which the colors of reconstructed images may be reversed (i.e., the black and white are reversed). If the color of text is also the secret information, the incorrect-color problem will compromise the secret. Additionally, Wang's scheme is only suitable for the 2-out-of-<i>n</i> case, i.e., (<i>k</i>,<i>n</i>)-RIVCS where <i>k</i>=2. In this paper, we propose a general (<i>k</i>,<i>n</i>)-RIVCS, where <i>k</i> and <i>n</i> are any integers, that is able to reveal correct colors of all regions. This paper has made three main contributions: 1) our scheme is a general (<i>k</i>,<i>n</i>)-RIVCS, where <i>k</i> and <i>n</i> can be any integers; 2) the incorrect-color problem is solved; and 3) our (<i>k</i>,<i>n</i>)-RIVCS is theoretically proven to satisfy the security and contrast conditions.","authors": [{"name": "Ching-Nung Yang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6111279/6111279-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Ching-Nung Yang (SM'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, both from the Department of Telecommunication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1983 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1997.", "From 1987 to 1989, and from 1990 to 1999, he was with the Telecommunication Laboratory and with the Training Institute Kaohsiung Center, Chunghwa Telecom Company, Ltd., Kaohsiung, Taiwan, respectively.

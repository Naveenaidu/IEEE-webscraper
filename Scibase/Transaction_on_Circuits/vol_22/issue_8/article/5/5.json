This algorithm, named multidimensional multiscale parser (MMP)-Video, is based on the H.264/AVC video encoder, but uses a pattern-matching paradigm instead of the state-of-the-art transform-quantization-entropy encoding approach. The proposed method adopts the use of multiscale recurrent patterns to compress both spatial and temporal prediction residues, totally replacing the use of transforms and quantization. Experimental results show that the coding performance of MMP-Video is better than the one of H.264/AVC high profile, especially for medium to high bit-rates. The gains range up to 0.7 dB, showing that, in spite of its larger computational complexity, the use of multiscale recurrent pattern matching paradigm deserves being investigated as an alternative for video compression.","authors": [{"name": "Nelson C.

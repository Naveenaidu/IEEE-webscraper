Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.","authors": [{"name": "Andrea Zanella", "affiliation": "Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy", "bio": {"graphic": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/6810798/6740844/6740844-photo-1-small.gif", "p": ["Andrea Zanella (S\u201998\u2013M\u201901\u2013SM\u201913) recieved the Laurea degree in computer engineering and Ph.D. degree in electronic and telecommunications engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.", "He was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2000.

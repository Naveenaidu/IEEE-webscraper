These diagrams give a graphical representation of the machine performance under all possible conditions. Such quantities as power loss, lower input, power output, field current., etc., for any operating condition, can be obtained by inspection. These diagrams have the same field of usefulness as the circle diagram of the inductionmotor. The transmission network circle diagram can be applied to the induction motor, yielding in the approximate representation the Heyland diagram, which is merely a special case of the more general diagram. The transmission network method of attack gives a straight-forward solution to many induction motor problems that would otherwise be difficult to handle; such as a motor equipped with a phase advancer.","authors": [{"name": "Frederick Emmons Terman", "affiliation": "Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford University, California"}, {"name": "Theodore Louis Lenzen", "affiliation": "Graduate students, Stanford University"}, {"name": "Cecil Louis Freedman", "affiliation": "Graduate students, Stanford University"}, {"name": "Kenneth Alfred Rogers", "affiliation": "Graduate students, Stanford University"}],"citations":[null]}

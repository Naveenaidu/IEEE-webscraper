Room 2 in the Engineering Societies Bldg., where the meeting was held, was filled to its capacity with the 250 members attending. There were three speakers, each treating a different phase of the general subject &#x201C;System Connections.&#x201D; A. E. Powers of the Westinghouse Elec. &#x0026; Mfg. Co., gave a general conception of stability, both static and transient. He demonstrated his points very effectively with an ingenious mechanical model. The second speaker, I. H. Summers of the General Electric Co., gave a talk on the more commonly employed schemes of system connection &#x2014; the ring bus, the synchronizing bus, double windings, and &#x201C;synchronized at the load.&#x201D; The last speaker, T. Maxwell of the United Elec. Lt. &#x0026; Pr. Co., gave a r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of experience with the &#x201C;synchronized-at the-load&#x201D; connection as employed in New York City. A general discussion followed.","authors":"none","citations":[null]}

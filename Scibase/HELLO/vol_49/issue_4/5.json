The forms of insulation discussed are: I. Line insulation: suspension type, with and without arcing rings, pin type, and wood alone and in combination with porcelain. II. Post type insulators, with and without arcing rings. III. Safety gaps with either needle or spherical electrodes. IV. Oil gaps.","authors": [{"name": "J. J.

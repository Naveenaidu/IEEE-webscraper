It then describes a new model of a cathode ray oscillograph developed for the expansion of field and laboratory tests in 1929. A circuit is shown for obtaining a unidirectional time axis on the oscillograms, in which the timing movement is started by an impulse from the surge to be measured. In the appendix, a simple and concise formula for the sensitivity of a cathode ray oscillograph is developed. This has been derived by Mr. Lewis R. Smith and takes into account the change of the mass of the electron at speeds approaching that of light. At the frequently used cathode voltage of 60 kv., this phenomenon causes a deviation of 5 per cent from the value which would be expected otherwise.","authors": [{"name": "O.

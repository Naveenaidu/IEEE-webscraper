Past attempts to improve the rupturing performance of oil circuit breakers are reviewed and the results of an investigation of the processes of a-c. arc extinction in oil are discussed, from which conclusions are drawn as to the degree of efficiency with which oil has been used in conventional oil circuit breakers. A description is given of a new device known as the deion grid, developed to permit the application of scientific principles to arc extinction in oil, and its theory of operation is discussed, together with the results of interrupting tests in both the laboratory and field Conclusions are drawn as to the effectiveness of this device in improving the rupturing performance of oil breakers and its suitability for use where questions of system stability are involved.","authors": [{"name": "B.

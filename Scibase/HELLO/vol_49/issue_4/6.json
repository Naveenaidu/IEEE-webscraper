The territory served and the distribution of load in it are also given. The fundamental plan of the system of the Philadelphia Electric Company is outlined, including information on the location and capacity of the principal stations and elements of the transmission system. The various reasons and conditions which have led to the development of the system are explained. The major equipment, such as generators, transformers, synchronous condensers, etc., is described, with particular reference to the adaptability of their characteristics to the conditions to be met. Interconnections with other electric utilities are briefly outlined. The operating procedure relating particularly to allocation of load to the various generating stations, reserve capacity, and frequency control, is discussed and operating experience, including information regarding unstable operation at times of line faults, presented. In conclusion there are also presented the more important basic principles which are followed so far as practicable in the development of the Philadelphia system.","authors": [{"name": "Raymond Bailey", "affiliation": "Electrical Engineer, Philadelphia Electric Co., Philadelphia, Pa."}],"citations":[null]}

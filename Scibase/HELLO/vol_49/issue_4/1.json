Philo-Canton 73-mi., two-circuit line made during 1929 with surge recorders, cathode ray oscillograph, lightning stroke recorders, and a lightning generator. Data are presented on the magnitude of lightning voltage surges, the attenuation of these surges as they travel along the line, and the difference in attenuation between positive and negative lightning surges. The preponderance of positive lightning surges is indicated; but the fewer negative surges produce the highest voltage on the line. The lightning stroke recorders gave data on the polarity of the direct strokes, and the magnitude of the current in the lightning stroke. Lightning arrester performance on lightning and switching surges is analyzed, and typical surges obtained by the cathode ray oscillograph are given for both cases. The magnitude and shape of lightning waves occurring on the line are shown and these waves analyzed as to duration of front, tail, and total length. These data are discussed as they relate to the proximity and rate of discharge of clouds producing lightning surges. General conclusions are drawn based on the data obtained in the investigation.","authors": [{"name": "Philip Sporn", "affiliation": "American Gas and Electric Company, New York"}, {"name": "W. L.

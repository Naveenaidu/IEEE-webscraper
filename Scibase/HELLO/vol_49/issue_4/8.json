For the e. m. f. in a closed circuit e &#x003D; &#x2014; d &#x03D5;/dt, the restriction is slated that the circuit is a closed loop of infinitesimal cross-section and without parallel branches. More complicated circuits are to be calculated by replacing them by a number of elementary circuits. Where there are moving contacts and conductors of finite cross-section, the rule e &#x003D; B l v should be used. A discussion is given of calculations by considering magnetic fields to have velocities and the restriction is slated that in general, the resultant magnetic field should not be used with the B l v rule, when it is made up of component fields having velocities which differ in magnitude or direction.","authors": [{"name": "Herbert Bristol Dwight", "affiliation": "Electrical Machinery, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass."}],"citations":[null]}

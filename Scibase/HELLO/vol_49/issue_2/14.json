If the auto-transformer is isolated, this may lead to larger voltages, and if grounded, to larger currents than what would ordinarily be expected. The analysis of an important installation (75,000-kv-a., three-phase units at Detroit) is given below, for various possible connections and conditions of operation. Features of the analysis are: (A) A novel theory and method of auto-transformer circuit representation was developed to handle some aspects of this problem that otherwise appeared elusive.<sup>2</sup> The method is applicable to all networks involving auto-transformers. (B) The rather startling fact is brought out and explained that fault currents to ground on the secondary lines of an auto-transformer may be larger when stepping-up than when stepping-down. The prediction has been verified by test.","authors": [{"name": "A. Boyajian", "affiliation": "Transformer Engg. Dept., General Electric Company, Pittsfield, Mass."}],"citations":[null]}

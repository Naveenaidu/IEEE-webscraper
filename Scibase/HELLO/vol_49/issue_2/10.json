The present paper emphasizes the fact that this is true not only for glass but also for fused quartz and for celluloid. By the elimination of edge-effect, the following breakdown gradients were obtained: For celluloid, 2,500,000 volts/cm.; for glass, 3,100,000 to 5,000,000 volts/cm.; and for mica, 10,600,000 volts/cm. The various methods of eliminating edge-effect are discussed and compared and an attempt is made to correlate the electrical properties of the glasses with their chemical composition.","authors": [{"name": "P.

A description of the installations on a 132-kv. network having an extent of 2500 linear miles is given and the general experience with carrier, which is the sole means of communication used by the power companies on that system, is outlined. Extensive experience with various types and makes of coupling capacitors is described. Experience with the protective system, the lead-in system, the tuning used in connection with the coupling, the transmitting system, and the receiving system is given. Definite data are cited as to cost, maintenance, reliability, traffic, and safety.","authors": [{"name": "Philip Sporn", "affiliation": "American Gas and Electric Company, New York, N.

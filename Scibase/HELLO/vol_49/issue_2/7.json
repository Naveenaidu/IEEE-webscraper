The system has been applied to cities of the second class and smaller, although load density in certain cases is high. Each individual installation was made after a specific study of conditions involved. Underlying principles on which all of the designs are based are: (1) Primary supply at generator voltage (11-kv. or 13-kv.), (2) omission of feeder regulators, (3) simplified transformer vault design with barrier wall between primary and secondary equipment, (4) high-reactance transformers, usually inherent, (5) use of secondary network protectors, (6) three-phase four-wire secondaries, (7) use of 250,000-cir. mil. secondary mains (or smaller) forming a solid grid without fuses. The operating experience of the installations made thus far has justified their application. The use of the system in other areas will be considered in future planning.","authors": [{"name": "R. M.

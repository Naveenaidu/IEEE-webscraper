It explains first that autogenous welding is divided into two main classes, viz., gas and electric; that electric arc welding is divided into two classes, viz., metallic and carbon arc. Gas and metallic arc welding in general require beveling of plates for butt welds while carbon arc welding does not. The controlling variables in carbon arc welding are (1) amperes in the arc, (2) voltage across the arc, (3) magnetic field about the arc, (4) atmosphere about the arc, (5) speed of feed, and (6) filling-in material. Discussion is given of the effect of each of these variables of the resulting weld with special reference to the action of a magnetic field parallel to the direction of the arc upon the current in the arc and the effect of the atmosphere about the arc on the ductility of the resulting weld.","authors": [{"name": "J.

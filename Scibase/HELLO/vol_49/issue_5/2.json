Now, artificial light need no longer be a poor substitute to be used when daylight fails. It costs no more than daylight and it is superior in a number of respects. It can be obtained when and where desired. It need seldom fail. It can be used effectively to supplement daylight, thereby making daytime operations in work-places safer and more efficient. It also makes possible multiple-shift or continuous operation.","authors":"none","citations":[null]}

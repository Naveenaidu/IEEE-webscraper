An ordinary sphere-gap does not give stable operation for any length of time. A special form of gap which gives satisfactory operation is described. Direct current may be obtained from the system if a proper wave-filter is utilized. Finally, the application of the system as a generator of successive unidirectional voltage impulses is discussed.","authors": [{"name": "Shiro Sano", "affiliation": "Sano Electric Manufacturing Co., Tokyo, Japan"}],"citations":[null]}

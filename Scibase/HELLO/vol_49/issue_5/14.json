Choice of operating frequencies, amounts of transmitter power, directive transmitting and receiving antennas, automatic gain controls in receivers, and voice-operated switching devices are all factors which may be invoked to aid in solving these problems. The way in which they have been applied in the transatlantic systems and the results which have been obtained are set forth briefly.","authors": [{"name": "Ralph Bown", "affiliation": "Department of Development and Research, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, New York, N.

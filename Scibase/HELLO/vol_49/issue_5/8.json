These formulas enable the effects of magnetizing current, core loss, and primary resistance on maximum torque, starting current, and so forth, to be readily taken into account with engineering accuracy: A new form of power-factor chart is presented, which permits of the power factor-load curve of any motor being conveniently determined from no-load test data. Exact values of power factor can be obtained from the chart by applying differential corrections, for which formulas are given. The methods outlined were developed to secure an optimum combination of speed, accuracy, and consistency in design calculations, and have been in regular use for the past seven years.","authors": [{"name": "P.

The characteristics of this motor are analyzed and demonstrated by oscillograms. Since the well-known theory of synchronous and repulsion motor can easily be applied for this double motor, no equations are given. For illustration of the characteristics various oscillograms and test curves are given.","authors": [{"name": "H. C. Specht", "affiliation": "Westinghouse Elec. &#x0026; Mfg.

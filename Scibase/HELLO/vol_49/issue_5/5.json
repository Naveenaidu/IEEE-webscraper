Formulas are given for the protective ratio due to one and two ground conductors. It is shown that for any number of ground conductors, it is not necessary to compute the charges on the power conductors.","authors": [{"name": "Herbert Bristol Dwight", "affiliation": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., and New England Power Construction Company"}],"citations":[null]}

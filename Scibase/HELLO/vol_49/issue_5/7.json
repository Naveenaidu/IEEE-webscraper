A brief r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; is given of the improvements in performance and size desired in lightning arresters. Reference is made to laboratory tests on insulation protected with arresters to determine the limits of discharge voltage required for good local protection. Oscillograms show that the new autovalve arresters meet these requirements. Successful operating experience with these arresters is staled to give final verification of the results obtained in the laboratory investigations. The steps in the development of materials are described and the materials finally chosen and the design of arresters are considered. The performance is discussed and illustrated by oscillograms covering a wide range of currents, both with and without power voltage applied. The size of the new arresters is about one-half that of the present commercial autovalve arresters. One of the probable benefits resulting from this reduction in size is the possibility of making practicable the protection of high-voltage lines against lightning flashover.","authors": [{"name": "J.

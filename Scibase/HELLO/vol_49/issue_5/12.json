Data were secured on attenuation with one, two, and three conductors in parallel, with and without ground wires. A study was made of the influence of ground wires in reducing voltages induced by overhead discharging clouds, and also the effect on surges of entering or leaving a section of line having ground wires. A brief study was made comparing steel and copper for ground wires. The effect of ground resistance in lower footings was considered and a method given for measuring surge impedance of transmission lines.","authors": [{"name": "K. B.

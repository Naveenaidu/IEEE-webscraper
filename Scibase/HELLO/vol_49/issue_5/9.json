The Duquesne Light Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has experienced these surges. This paper outlines tests conducted to determine the influence the steam turbine governors have in starting or sustaining a surge condition. The conclusions assumed are: 1. The governor system installed at Colfax Power Station will not start system surging. 2. The governor system will not sustain load oscillations.","authors": [{"name": "T. E.

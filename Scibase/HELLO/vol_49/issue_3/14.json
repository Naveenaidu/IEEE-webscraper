These two major developments, and some important corollary inventions and applications, are discussed in this paper. Reference is made to articles previously published describing recent developments at length. In addition, the paper contains descriptions of: A two-element cable recorder code adapted to land-line transmission. A cable printer system using a two-element code of practically the same time length as three-element recorder code. A typical installation of Pernot superimposed cable carrier apparatus. A brief account of the steps which have been taken to balance an inductively loaded duplex cable.","authors": [{"name": "L. S. Coggeshall", "affiliation": "Western Union Telegraph Co., New York, N.

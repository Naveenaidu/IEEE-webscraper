The design is a new departure from customary engineering practise in that all live parts are immersed in oil and enclosed in metal housings with each phase in its own independent compartment. The switchgear insures maximum safety to the operating and maintenance personnel and reduces construction costs for power station switching. The design is well adapted to mass production which should lead toward standardization resulting in a material savings in cost of manufacturing.","authors": [{"name": "A. M.

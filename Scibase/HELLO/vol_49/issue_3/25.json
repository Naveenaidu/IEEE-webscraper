This will be increased yearly so that the topographic survey of the United States may be completed in 18 years instead of in from 80 to 100 years as would be the case under the old program. This means employment of a large number of engineers; and even those not employed will benefit with the availability of adequate topographic maps.","authors":"none","citations":[null]}

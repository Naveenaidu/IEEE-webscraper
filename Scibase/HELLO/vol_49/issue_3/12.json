This paper sets forth the principles involved and the plan adopted by the Detroit Edison Company. The description of the area served and the classification of customers indicates that the system is essentially of the metropolitan substation type supplemented by a 120-kv. transmission system. The importance of selecting proper circuit voltages and arrangements and their bearing on service reliability, system simplicity, and cost is discussed. The underlying principles and the &#x201C;Loose Linked&#x201D; Power Area Plan adopted to accomplish those principles are set forth. These are supplemented by the plan for short circuit and stability control and the resultant classification of substations, power sources, and protection schemes. Those characteristics of major electrical equipment affected by the plan are outlined. Operating procedure and results are given.","authors": [{"name": "S. M.

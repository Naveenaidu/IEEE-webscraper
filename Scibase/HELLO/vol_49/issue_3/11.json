Even as far back as 1911, Stanton<sup>1</sup> and Abell<sup>2</sup> after making a series of Wohler tests of welded material, advised against welds for variable stress applications. However, recent investigations such as those described in this paper, justify a more general increase in the use of welding under these conditions.","authors": [{"name": "Morris Stone", "affiliation": "Westinghouse Elec. &#x0026; Mfg.

After a review of the theory of this relationahip, the methods developed in this study for observing the anomalous charging current in condensers in the time range from 0.0007 to 0.100 sec. after impressing a steady potential are described. The methods used in observing the &#x201C;normal leakage current&#x201D; and the alternating energy loss and capacitance in the frequency range from 200 to 4000 cycles per sec. are also described. The results of measurements by these methods on mica, glass, treated cloth, and paraffin paper condensers are given. These measurements include a series giving the effect of varying temperature on the properties of the glass and treated cloth condensers. Finally, the comparisons between the dielectric energy loss and capacitance variation with frequency predicted on the basis of the d-c. anomalous charging current tests and the variations which were actually observed are given. These comparisons show that a fair agreement exists between the predicted and observed curves.","authors": [{"name": "R. R.
